# Weather-Forecast

*/image screenshot code here/*

## Description

In this challenge I built a 5-day weather forecast app using a weather api. The app contains current temperature, wind and humidity. I also included a search for city function in the script and there is also a local storage of previous cities you have searched.

## Installation

I used visual studio code to create this code in a script.js file, index.html and a style.css file.

## Usage
